# React Template
A simple React template which was mostly intended for use by Alan. If you happen to not be Alan, then know that Alan wishes you luck. Alan also needs to do all sorts of work here. Maintaining a React template is harder than he thought. It works as is, but new things are always nice.
## Creating your app
The first step is to clone or fork this repo, and then build something great!
You can run the project using the standard `npm start`. Once you're ready to deploy, you can build the project using `npm run build`. Beyond this... well... at this point, there isn't much more to say.
